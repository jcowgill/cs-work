Computer Science - TPOP
=======================

This repository contains various programming exercises I wrote during the
"Theory and Practice of Programming" module of my Computer Science course of
York University.

Python Version
--------------
Unless otherwise specified, anything in the "mini" directory is in **Python 3**.
Everything else is in Python 2 (i know this is very confusing)
